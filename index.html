                <h2>Eduard Ion Tudorache</h2>
                <h3>Software Developer</h3>
                <p class="about-text">Motivated individual, looking for challanges to help me develop not only my skills but also myself as a person moving forward.
                    More than 5 years of experience in customer oriented position, be it as a waiter or as a small-scale manager.
                    It all started back in the day with my play station 1, then 2, then my first laptop. Troubleshooting it all myself, problem-solving everything i stumbled upon, growing more and more curious about it. Finally, in early 2022 decided to move into proper software development.
                    Upon many suggestions and informing on the subject, I ended up joining Ironhack in the part time web development course to learn all about web development one could learn in 6 months.
                    Main technologies learned there were: <b>Javascript, HTML5, CSS3, NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB, Mongoose, and many more. But more importantly, skills like problem-solving, adapting, and agile development.</b>
                    Moving into the tech world hence it has been my passion since i was a little child, started off with hardware, building my own pc and now slowly crawling my way into the software world.
